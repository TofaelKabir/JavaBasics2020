	 1a) Print "Hello World, Welcome to Java"
	 1b) shortcut of sysout.(ctrl+spacebar)
	 1c) camel casing
	 2)`Use of System.out.print
	 3) use of multiple system.out.println
	 4) use of \n  \n
	 5) Variable declared and initialize before method
	 6) Method implemented and initialize
	 7a)Variable declared and initialize after main method 
	 7b)constructor declared and initialize
	 7c) Parameterized constructor
	 8) Return type method
	 9) Getter and setter method
	 10) Write code where you can print your full name and address (use variable, method, constructor, main method).
	 11) write code where you can show different type of constructor, for example: Employee class
	 12) class variable/ local variable
	 13) Encapsulation
	 14) Inheritance
	 15) Abstraction: 
	 What is abstract class and relation with regular class? Can they extend each other
	 a class can extends a class or an abstract class
	 an abstract class can extends a class or an abstract class
	 what is interface
	 an interface can extends an interface
	 a class can implement multiple interface
	 an abstract class can implement multiple interface
	 a class can extends abstract class and implement Interface [what is a concrete class]
	 Members of a Java interface are public by default.
	 Java abstract class can have class members like private, protected, etc.
	 Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables.
	 Interface has only static and final variables. ALSO PUBLIC VARIABLE
	 Interface supports multiple inheritance. IMPLEMENTS MULTIPLE INTERFACE
	 Abstract class doesn't support multiple inheritance.
	 
	 
	 
	 
	 
	 Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details from the user and exposing only the essential features of a particular concept or object. In Java, abstraction is achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.
